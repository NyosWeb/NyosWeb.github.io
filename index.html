        <h3>How I Stay Motivated:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1. I set a goal for myself each day to test if I'd really <em>learnt</em> something new that day.</li>
            <li> 2. I try to find a different way to learn if I cannot figure it out how it is now as to not get discouraged.</li>
            <li> 3. I got my friend to help me remember to stay consistent, not letting me give up when I get frustrated.</li>
        </ul>
